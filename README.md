This web application is designed for engineers who work with monitoring flaring operations.
This current version (Beta 1.0) has been built with neural networks models and math algorithms that help in detecting
and measuring flame geometry parameters, including flame length, lift-off of the flame base, flame tilt, 
and more.


Key features:
Flare monitoring tracker
Tracking and flame geometry metrics module
